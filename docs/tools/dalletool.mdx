# `DallETool`

## Description

This tool is used to give the Agent the ability to generate images using the DALL-E model. It is a transformer-based model that generates images from textual descriptions. 
This tool allows the Agent to generate images based on the text input provided by the user.

## Installation

Install the crewai_tools package
```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Remember that when using this tool, the text must be generated by the Agent itself. The text must be a description of the image you want to generate.

```python
from crewai_tools import DallETool

Agent(
    ...
    tools=[DallETool()],
)
```

## Arguments

- `model`: The DALL-E model to use (e.g., "dall-e-3")
- `size`: Image size (e.g., "1024x1024")
- `quality`: Image quality ("standard" or "hd")
- `n`: Number of images to generate

## Configuration Example

```python
from crewai_tools import DallETool

dalle_tool = DallETool(model="dall-e-3",
                       size="1024x1024",
                       quality="standard",
                       n=1)

Agent(
    ...
    tools=[dalle_tool]
)
```

The parameters are based on the `client.images.generate` method from the OpenAI API. For more information on the parameters, 
please refer to the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction?lang=python).
