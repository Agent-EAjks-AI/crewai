## Understanding Processes
<Tip>
  Processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. 
  These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.
</Tip>

## Process Types

CrewAI supports two process types that determine how tasks are assigned to agents:

- **Static/Assigned Process** (formerly "Sequential"): In this process, each task must be pre-assigned to a specific agent. While the name "Sequential" was previously used, it's important to note that tasks are always executed in the order they are defined, regardless of the process type chosen. The key characteristic of this process is that it requires explicit agent assignments for each task.

- **Dynamic/Unassigned Process** (formerly "Hierarchical"): In this process, you do not have to assign agents to tasks explicitly. Instead, the crew will assess available agents and automatically select the most suitable one for each task based on their roles and expertise. This requires specifying either a manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) to handle the agent selection and task delegation.

- **Consensual Process** (Planned): Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a Static/Assigned process
# Each task must have an agent pre-assigned
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.sequential  # Note: The enum value remains 'sequential' for backward compatibility
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a Dynamic/Unassigned process
# Tasks will be automatically assigned to suitable agents
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Note: The enum value remains 'hierarchical' for backward compatibility
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```
**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_tasks` are defined prior to creating a `Crew` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Static/Assigned Process

This process type requires explicit agent assignments for each task. Tasks are executed in their defined order, with the output of one task serving as context for the next. This approach provides direct control over which agent handles each specific task.

To customize task context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Task` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

## Dynamic/Unassigned Process

This process type enables automatic agent selection through a manager component. You must specify either a custom manager agent or a manager language model (`manager_llm`). The manager oversees task execution by:
- Analyzing task requirements
- Selecting the most suitable agent based on roles and expertise
- Delegating tasks automatically
- Reviewing outputs and assessing task completion

## Process Class: Detailed Overview

The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion

The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. 
This documentation has been updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.
