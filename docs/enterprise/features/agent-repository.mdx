# Agent Repository

The Agent Repository allows you to store, manage, and reuse agents across your CrewAI projects. This feature streamlines the development process by enabling you to configure agents once and use them in multiple projects.

## How It Works

When you create an agent in the CrewAI interface, it's stored in the Agent Repository. You can then initialize these agents in your code using the `from_repository` parameter.

## Usage

To use an agent from the repository in your CrewAI project, initialize it with the following code:

```python
from crewai import Agent

# Initialize the agent with its role
agent = Agent(from_repository="python-job-researcher")
```

### Creating a Crew with Repository Agents

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task

agent = Agent(from_repository="python-job-researcher")

job_search_task = Task(
    description="Search for recent Python developer job listings online",
    expected_output="Markdown list of 5 recent Python developer jobs with details.",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[job_search_task], verbose=True)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## Important Notes

- The `from_repository` value must match the agent's role in a URL-safe format.
- If you change an agent's role after creation, you must update the `from_repository` value in your code accordingly, or you won't be able to find the agent anymore.
- Make sure you have permission to use the agent as mentioned in the key points.

## Agent Configuration

When configuring an agent in the repository, you can specify:

1. **Role** - The agent's primary function (e.g., "Python Job Researcher")
2. **Goal** - What the agent aims to achieve (e.g., "Find Python developer job opportunities")
3. **Backstory** - Context for the agent's behavior
4. **Tools** - Available capabilities for the agent to use when performing tasks
5. **Visibility Controls** - Who can access and use the agent

## Managing Agents

The Agent Repository interface provides functionality to:

- View all available agents
- Add new agents
- Edit existing agents
- Delete agents
- View agent details including usage examples

By leveraging the Agent Repository, you can build more modular and reusable AI workflows while maintaining a central location for managing your agents.
