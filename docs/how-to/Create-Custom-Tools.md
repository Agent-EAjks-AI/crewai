## Prerequisites

Before creating your own tools, ensure you have the crewAI extra tools package installed:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Creating Custom Tools

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

To create a personalized tool, inherit from `BaseTool` and define the necessary attributes and the `_run` method:

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "My Custom Tool"
    description: str = "This tool performs a specific task. Provide a clear description for effective utilization."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implement your tool's logic here
        result = f"Processed: {argument}"
        return result
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

For simpler tools, use the `@tool` decorator to define the tool's attributes and functionality directly within a function:

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Simple Calculator")
def simple_calculator(operation: str, a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)."""
    if operation == "add":
        return a + b
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return a - b
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return a * b
    elif operation == "divide":
        return a / b if b != 0 else "Error: Division by zero"
    else:
        return "Error: Invalid operation"
```

## Advanced Tool Features

### Implementing Caching

Optimize tool performance with custom caching strategies:

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Cacheable Tool")
def cacheable_tool(input_data: str) -> str:
    """Tool that benefits from caching results."""
    # Simulate complex processing
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    return f"Processed: {input_data}"

def cache_strategy(arguments: dict, result: str) -> bool:
    # Implement your caching logic here
    return len(arguments['input_data']) > 10  # Cache results for longer inputs

cacheable_tool.cache_function = cache_strategy
```

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in your tools:

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class RobustTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Robust Processing Tool"
    description: str = "Processes data with error handling."

    def _run(self, data: str) -> str:
        try:
            # Your processing logic here
            result = self._process_data(data)
            return result
        except ValueError as e:
            return f"Error: Invalid input - {str(e)}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}"

    def _process_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        # Implement your actual data processing logic here
        if not data:
            raise ValueError("Empty input")
        return f"Successfully processed: {data}"
```

### Dynamic Tool Calling

Implement dynamic tool selection based on input:

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Dynamic Tool Selector")
def dynamic_tool_selector(task_description: str) -> str:
    """Selects and calls the appropriate tool based on the task description."""
    if "calculate" in task_description.lower():
        return simple_calculator("add", 5, 3)  # Example usage
    elif "process" in task_description.lower():
        return cacheable_tool("Sample input")
    else:
        return "No suitable tool found for the given task."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Documentation**: Provide detailed descriptions for each tool, including expected inputs and outputs.
2. **Modular Design**: Create small, focused tools that can be combined for complex tasks.
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your tools and their parameters.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to make your tools robust.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Use caching for expensive operations when appropriate.
6. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your tools with various inputs to ensure reliability.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines and incorporating advanced functionalities into your tool creation and management processes, you can leverage the full capabilities of the crewAI framework. This approach enhances both the development experience and the efficiency of your AI agents, allowing for more sophisticated and powerful AI-driven applications.
