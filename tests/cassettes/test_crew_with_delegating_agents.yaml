      Answer: AI agents are revolutionizing industries by automating complex processes,
      enhancing decision-making, and providing personalized experiences. In healthcare,
      they assist in diagnosing diseases and predicting patient outcomes with unprecedented
      accuracy. In finance, AI agents automate trading and fraud detection, significantly
      reducing risks. The retail sector benefits from virtual shopping assistants
      that offer tailored recommendations and streamline customer service. As we look
      to the future, AI agents have the potential to transform autonomous driving,
      streamline supply chain management, and even contribute to scientific research
