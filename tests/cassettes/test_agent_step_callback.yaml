      broad field encompassing a wide range of technologies and applications. From
      natural language processing to computer vision, AI algorithms are designed to
      simulate human intelligence and improve decision-making processes. Through techniques
      such as machine learning and deep learning, AI systems can analyze vast amounts
      of data to recognize patterns and make informed predictions. This transformative
