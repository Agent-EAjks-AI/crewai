      answer based on the standard criteria for scoring titles.\\n\\nFinal Answer:
      Here is your detailed answer on how to score a title between 1 and 5, specifically
      for the title 'The impact of AI in the future of work':\\n\\n1. **Relevance**:\\n
      \   - **Score 1**: The title is completely irrelevant to the given context or
      topic.\\n    - **Score 2**: The title has limited relevance, touching only tangentially
      on the topic.\\n    - **Score 3**: The title is moderately relevant but lacks
      focus or specificity.\\n    - **Score 4**: The title is relevant and addresses
      the topic directly with clear focus.\\n    - **Score 5**: The title is highly
      relevant, directly addressing the core topic comprehensively and precisely.\\n\\n2.
      **Impact**:\\n    - **Score 1**: The title suggests minimal or no significant
      impact on the reader or the field.\\n    - **Score 2**: The title indicates
      some impact but does not clearly convey its significance.\\n    - **Score 3**:
      The title reflects a moderate impact, highlighting importance but lacking strong
      emphasis.\\n    - **Score 4**: The title conveys a strong impact, clearly indicating
      its importance to the field.\\n    - **Score 5**: The title suggests a profound
      impact, compelling the reader with a sense of urgency or significance.\\n\\n3.
      **Originality**:\\n    - **Score 1**: The title is generic, common, or overused,
      with no original contribution.\\n    - **Score 2**: The title shows minimal
      originality, being slightly more specific than a generic title.\\n    - **Score
      3**: The title has some original elements but may still feel somewhat familiar.\\n
      \   - **Score 4**: The title is original, presenting a fresh perspective on
      the topic.\\n    - **Score 5**: The title is highly original, offering a unique
      and innovative approach or angle.\\n\\n4. **Clarity**:\\n    - **Score 1**:
      The title is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly worded.\\n    - **Score 2**: The
      title is somewhat clear but may contain jargon or unclear elements.\\n    -
      **Score 3**: The title is reasonably clear but could be more concise or straightforward.\\n
      \   - **Score 4**: The title is clear, well-structured, and easy to understand.\\n
      \   - **Score 5**: The title is exceptionally clear, concise, and leaves no
      room for misinterpretation.\\n\\n**Example Application:**\\n\\nFor the title
      'The impact of AI in the future of work', let's evaluate it based on the given
      criteria:\\n\\n- **Relevance**: 5 (Highly relevant as it directly addresses
      the topic of AI and its role in the future workplace)\\n- **Impact**: 4 (Conveys
      strong impact, emphasizing the importance of AI in future work scenarios)\\n-
      **Originality**: 3 (Moderately original; it is specific but the theme of AI
      and future work is widely discussed)\\n- **Clarity**: 4 (Clear and straightforward
      but could perhaps be more concise by rephrasing)\\n\\nOverall Score: This title
      could be rated around a 4, as it effectively communicates its relevance, impact,
      and clarity, but with room for slight improvement in originality and specificity.\\n\\nThis
      detailed explanation should help you understand how to evaluate and score titles
      effectively across different criteria.\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n
