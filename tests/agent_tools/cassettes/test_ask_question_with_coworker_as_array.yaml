      Answer: As an expert researcher specializing in technology, particularly AI
      and AI agents, I have a nuanced perspective on the matter. AI agents have their
      strengths and weaknesses, and my appreciation for them is rooted in their potential
      to transform various industries and improve efficiencies. AI agents can automate
      repetitive tasks, provide insightful data analyses, and enhance user experiences
      through intelligent interactions. However, it's also critical to address the
      ethical considerations and potential risks associated with their use, such as
      biases in AI models, privacy concerns, and the need for transparency. In summary,
      I wouldn't say I hate AI agents; rather, I value their contributions and advocate
      for responsible and ethical development and deployment.\",\n        \"refusal\":
